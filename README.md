# Regression
In this repository, we will explore all aspects of regression analysis!  

We will construct various types of regression models, including **simple, multiple, polynomial, support vector, decision tree, and random forest regressions**!  

Following the construction of these models, we will evaluate their performance. Additionally, we will delve into the process of regression model selection in Python!  

* **Simple Linear Regression:** It is a statistical method that allows us to summarize and study relationships between two continuous (**quantitative**) variables by **fitting** a linear equation to observed data!  
$$y = b_{0} + b_{1}x_{1}$$

* **Multiple Linear Regression:** This is an extension of simple linear regression used to **predict an outcome** variable based on **multiple different predictor variables**!
$$y = b_{0} + b_{1}x_{1} + b_{2}x_{2}^{2} + ... + b_{n}x_{n}^{n}$$

* **Polynomial Regression:** This is a form of regression analysis in which the relationship between the independent variable *x* and dependent variable *y* is modeled as an *nth* degree polynomial!
$$y = b_{0} + b_{1}x_{1} + b_{2}x_{1}^{2} + ... +b_{n}x_{1}^{n}$$  

* **Support Vector Regression:** It is a type of Support Vector Machine that supports linear and non-linear regression to predict an outcome that could be a real or continuous number!
$$J(\beta) = \frac{1}{2} \beta' \beta + C \sum_{n=1}^{N} (\xi_n + \xi_n^*)$$
