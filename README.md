# Regression
In this repository, we will explore all aspects of regression analysis!  

We will construct various types of regression models, including **simple, multiple, polynomial, support vector, decision tree, and random forest regressions**!  

Following the construction of these models, we will evaluate their performance. Additionally, we will delve into the process of regression model selection in Python!  

**Simple Linear Regression:** It is a statistical method that allows us to summarize and study relationships between two continuous (**quantitative**) variables by **fitting** a linear equation to observed data!  

**Multiple Linear Regression:** This is an extension of simple linear regression used to **predict an outcome** variable based on **multiple different predictor variables**!  

**Polynomial Regression:** This is a form of regression analysis in which the relationship between the independent variable *x* and dependent variable *y* is modeled as an *nth* degree polynomial!  

**Support Vector Regression:** It is a type of Support Vector Machine that supports linear and non-linear regression to predict an outcome that could be a real or continuous number!
